# file-squire-bot
A telegram bot to fetch files from a remote machine

**NB: This branch doesn't include paths.py and the bot accesses files directly. Carefully select users who will be whitelisted.**

* Open `config.py`, set your **TOKEN** (string) and **WHITELIST** (list of user IDs)

* Start the bot. You are ready to fetch files from any device, e.g.
`/fetch c:/projects/file-squire-bot/squire.log`
